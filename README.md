# COVID_CO_Disparity

## Introduction
The population of the state of Colorado is comprised of 30% hispanic citizens, but 60% of the COVID-19 cases are afflicting hispanic people. In this project, I am exploring trends in environmental factors, education, english fluency, and food availability in regions of the state with high hispanic populations to determine possible reasons for this disparity.

This project is in collaboration with Sandra Halvatzis and Halvatzis Consulting for Colorado Hispanic Chamber of Commerce for Market Insights Report # 1002 - Driving Equitable Growth in Colorado: A Look Back to Move Forward
